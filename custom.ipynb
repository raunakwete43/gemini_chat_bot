      "3. **Phishing attack:** This involves creating a fake website that looks like the real login page for the Wi-Fi network. When the user enters their password into the fake website, it is sent to the attacker. This is a very effective way to hack into a Wi-Fi network, but it can also be very difficult to set up.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Malware attack:** This involves infecting the user's computer with malware that will steal the password for the Wi-Fi network. This is a very effective way to hack into a Wi-Fi network, but it can also be very difficult to create and distribute the malware.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, I strongly advise against attempting to hack into any Wi-Fi network. It is illegal and can have serious consequences. If you are experiencing problems with your Wi-Fi network, you should contact your internet service provider for assistance.\n"
